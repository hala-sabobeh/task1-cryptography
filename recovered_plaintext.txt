There are many ways to die in Gaza, although one does not have the luxury to choose.

You may be killed in a bombing, or be struck by a sniper's bullet as you try to collect food to stave off hunger, or starvation itself may claim your life. The Health Ministry says 116 people have died because of malnutrition, many of them babies and children.

In Gaza, the simplest, most basic necessity can also be lethal. Water is one of them. Every aspect of it can be dangerous: providing it, seeking it, drinking it, swimming in it.

Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has relentlessly targeted Gaza's water infrastructure. More than 85 percent of Gaza's water and sanitation structures are inoperable - including pipelines, wells, and treatment facilities.

Israel has blocked the entry of water-related materials to the Strip, making repairs difficult. It has also targeted the warehouse of the water utility authority, destroying equipment and spare parts.

Worst of all, workers trying to make repairs or operate water infrastructure have been directly targeted and killed. Working in the water sector has now become a deadly job.

Most recently, on July 21, the Israeli occupation forces attacked a desalination plant in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City, killing five people at the site. This was one of the few functioning water stations in the city.
